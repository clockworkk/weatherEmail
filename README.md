The python script weatherFind.py goes to the url specific to Houghton Michigan for weather.com and then parses the page
for the current temperature at the time that the script is being ran, the expected high for the day, and the expected low
for the day.  The script then authenticates with google mail and emails the selected email address the results of the parse.

This is soon to be altered to send text messages to a specific number either with twilio or something else.
